To start the exercises, open a Terminal window on your machine and do:

````
cd
git clone https://github.com/bobjacobsen/csc-exercises.git
````
(that might take a minute) then do:
````
source csc-exercises/CSC/setup
````

The result should look something like this (numbers may vary):
````
[csc_me@CSC2016 ~]$ git clone https://github.com/bobjacobsen/csc-exercises.git
