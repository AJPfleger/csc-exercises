Instructions for the 1st Exercise Sessions

The very first step is find somebody to work with and sit down together. The two of you will be working together on these exercises.  These have been designed to work best two two people (or occasionally three), not with one!

Next, get the School's virtual machine installed and running on one laptop, and then log in.  For more information on how to do that, see the School's [Laptop configuration page](https://indico.cern.ch/event/681081/page/12065-laptop-configuration). You can use the 2nd person's laptop to show the instructions or to take notes.

To start the exercises, open a Terminal window on your machine and do:
```
    cd
    git clone https://github.com/bobjacobsen/csc-exercises.git
```
(that might take a minute) then do:
```
    source csc-exercises/CSC/setup
```
The result should look something like this (numbers may vary, don't worry about that):
```
[csc_bob@CSC2018 ~]$ cd
[csc_bob@CSC2018 ~]$ git clone https://github.com/bobjacobsen/csc-exercises.git

Next, open the CSC/index.html file in your favorite web browser and follow those instructions.
This will be a URL something like [file:///home/csc_me/CSC/index.html](file:///home/csc_me/CSC/index.html), though you'll have to put your own account name in there.

Please read that index page's instructions all the way through.  We've put some general info at the top that you should now, and put some reference links at the bottom that you might discover you need later.
