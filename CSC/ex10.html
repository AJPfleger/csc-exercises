<h1>Exercise 10: Joint Development</h1>
 
<B>Note: This exercise is based on CVS, and needs to be updated to SVN/Git!</b>
<p>

Reminder:  Look at 
&lt;<A HREF="http://server/jake/CSC/index.html">http://server/jake/CSC/index.html</a>&gt; 
for updates or corrections!
 
<P>
Goal: Get some experience with the issues that make joint development difficult.
<P>
In this exercise, we're going to have groups of 4 students
work together to migrate a very small system to a new structure.

<P>
We don't have a lot of time to do this, but that's true in the 
real world, too. 
<p>
The basic task is to take the system of exercise 9, which consists
of Base, User1, User2 and Main packages, and move it forward to yet
another new interface for the log() method in Base.

<P>
When you want to start this exercise, come find Bob, who will put 
you in groups that want to start at about the same time.
You'll need people or pairs to do four things:

<UL>
<LI>Modify the Base package to provide the new capability
<LI>Modify User1 to use it
<LI>Modify User2 to use it
<LI>Do any needed updates in Main, and build the overall release
</UL>

<P>
Allocate these roles among yourselves. To make this more realistic, nobody
should work on more than one package. (It would be better if we could
also put you in separate time zones....) Try to find a way to do as much
in parallel as possible.

<p>
Next, discuss how what your strategy is.
Who is making what changes? Who is testing what? 
Who do you want to update the requirements files? 
Who puts things into CVS?
Make sure everybody knows who's doing what and when. 

<p>
Next, we'll create a central 
CVS repository by having one student (the one logged in to handle the
"Main" package) do:
<code><pre>
    cd
    tar xf /home/jake/CSC/exercise10CVS.tar
</pre></code>
which will create a common CVS repository for the teams.
You also need to make sure your permissions are set right:
<code><pre>
    cd
    chmod 755 .
    chmod -R g+w repo10
</pre></code>
<P>
Then everybody should do 

<code><pre>
    cd
    export CVSROOT=/home/<i>mainuser</i>/repo10
    tar xf /home/jake/CSC/exercise10.tar
    cd exercise10
    source setup.sh
    cvs co Base Main User1 User2
</pre></code>
(where <i>mainuser</i> is the login-id of the student with the CVS repository)
<P>
At this point each of you should have a working setup for development
in Base, User1, User2 and Main that's connected to a single CVS repository.
If anybody commits a change, their colleagues can get the change by doing a 
"cvs update" in the appropriate directory.
<P>
The actual change we want to make is shown by comments in the
v2-0 versions of Base.h and Base.cxx.  The team working on the 
Base package should make the code changes suggested by those
comments in a <u>new</u> version v3-0 of Base. The other teams should make
the changes necessary to be able to use that new Base capability.
<p>
Try to get all four teams working on making their changes in parallel.
That requires thinking about who should be doing what, and in what order.
In order to make this a real example of distributed development, it's important
that each person or team only work on their own part of the project.
<P>
For example, the User1 team should:
<OL>
<LI>Create the new version with:
<code><pre>
cmt create User1 v3-0
</pre></code>
<LI>Tell CVS about the directories just created:
<code><pre>
cvs add User1/v3-0
cvs add User1/v3-0/cmt
cvs add User1/v3-0/src
</pre></code>
<LI>Copy the earlier versions of files from v2-0/src and v2-0/cmt
<LI>Edit them as needed, build and test
<LI>When ready to send back to CVS, first tell cvs about them:
<code><pre>
cvs add cmt/requirements
cvs add cmt/Makefile
cvs add src/*.h
cvs add src/*.cxx
</pre></code>
and them commit them
<code><pre>
cvs commit -m"commiting my changes back for others to use" 
</pre></code>
</OL>
The collaborating groups can the pick up those changes with
<code><pre>
cvs -q update -d
</pre></code>
(The -q option makes it less verbose, so you can see what it's doing;
-d option tells CVS to look for new directories)
<P>
Meanwhile, what can the Main team be doing?  What does Base need to do first?
<p>
When you get it done and running, take a moment to think about
how much coordination you needed to do.  Did everything go as expected?
