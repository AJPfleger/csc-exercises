<h1>Exercise 3: Demonstration of profiling tools</h1>
 
Reminder: If there's been a correction to this exercise posted, 
update your local copy via
<A HREF="index.html#corrections">these instructions</a>
before proceeding.

<p> 
Goal: Get a feel for how profiling tools show you how a program behaves
<P>
First, create a local copy of the exercise files.
 
<CODE><PRE>
   cd
   ./csc_get exercise3.tar
   tar xf exercise3.tar
   cd exercise3
   source setup.sh
</PRE></CODE>
 
Take a look at the PerfCheck.java file. Let's say you want to find how
many prime numbers there are from 900,000 to 1,000,000 for some reason.
There are a couple ways to do this.  The programmer has come up
with two of them here:
<UL>
<LI>simpleCheck - for each number in the range, it does a divide by
all possible divisors to see if the number is prime
<LI>sieveCheck - uses the Sieve of Erathosenes to check, which involves
making an array and walking through it, marking off numbers that 
can be divided.
</UL>
It's not obvious which will be faster in this case.  simpleCheck can 
stop checking as soon as a factor is found, whereas sieveCheck seems to do
less division, but has to step through all the numbers below 900,000 too.
<P>
We'll profile these to see how much of a difference this makes. First, we compile and run it:
  
<CODE><PRE>
   ./build
   ./run
</PRE></CODE>
 
The "run" script just runs java with the profiling options.  
That will take a little while because we run for long enough to get good samples.
<p>
(Note that the 'run' script has disabled Java's run-time compilation. 
We've done this because the Java compiler is smart enough to compile away some of the inefficiencies 
in this sample program that we want you to track down yourself)
<p>
When it completes, you'll have a new "java.hprof.txt" file containing the raw profile information.  
Take a look at its structure using your favorite editor.
In particular note the measurements at the end of the file.
<P>
To browse this information in a more usable form, we run PerfAnal:
 
<CODE><PRE>
   ./analysis
</PRE></CODE>
 
The "analysis" script just invokes the PerfAnal class with java. 
The four windows shown in lecture will appear on your screen.  
The upper left one, "Method Times by Caller", 
shows that almost all of the time is used in PerfCheck.main, our testing program; 
the rest is spent in loading java classes, etc. 
If you click on the folder by PerfCheck to look inside, you'll see how it is spending its time.
<p>
Using this you can already tell that the "sieveCheck" is 
faster by maybe a factor of two.
Examine the slower routines carefully to see where the time goes.
<P>
Question: Where is the time really being spent?  
<P>
Look at the line number
display in the lower-right corner. 
Click on the PerfCheck.checkOne box to expand it.
It shows that (almost) all of the time is being spent on lines 23 and 26.
Those lines are in checkOne():

<CODE><PRE>
21:    static boolean checkOne(int test) {
22:        for (int factor = 2; 
23:             factor < (int) Math.sqrt(test); 
24:             factor++) {
25:             
26:          if (test % factor == 0) 
27:                return false;
28:        }
29:        return true;
30:    }
</PRE></CODE>

(We wrote the "for" statement on three lines so you can see which clauses are taking time)
<P>
Is the time being spent where you expect? Is this code wasting time?
Can you fix it?
(Don't forget to recompile with ./build after changing the program!)

<P>
When you run the program, it prints both the time spent in each of the
two algorithms, and also the number found.  Note that the two algorithms
are not finding the same answer!  At least one, and perhaps both
are not working correctly.  It doesn't matter if code is fast if it's 
giving the wrong answer.  We've provided a few JUnit tests in the
TestPerfCheck.java file.  To run them,

<CODE><PRE>
   java TestPerfCheck g
</PRE></CODE>

(the "g" argument runs with the GUI; omit that if you just want to run
from the command line)
<P>
Please use the tests to get both methods in PerfCheck giving the
right answer before comparing speeds again. 

<P>
Finally, go back to the performance display again to see if there are any obvious optimizations that can be made.

<p>
Which is the right algorithm to use here?

<p>
Which would be the right one if you were checking between 9 billion and 10 billion?

<p>
Which would be the right one if you were checking between 9 999 900 000 and 10 000 000 000?

<P>
(Hint: When checking
factors, should you check <u>up to</u> the square root of the
number, or <u>up to and including</u> the square root?)

<P>
Note:  You can't go too far with using sampling tools and small samples; those can really 
mislead you.  See the article on "How Profilers Lie" in the 
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jvb1zYRibzOw74VKnGsmTVfWkQcOxb_yc8JboebFDpA/edit#heading=h.so1co78qtmfd">Bilbiography</a> for more on this.
