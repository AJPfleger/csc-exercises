<h1>Exercise 5: Testing for C++ memory faults</h1>
  
Reminder:  Look at 
&lt;<A HREF="index.html">the index page</a>&gt; 
for updates or corrections!

<P>
Goal: Gain some experience with types of memory faults 
and tools that can help with them
<P>
First, create a local copy of the exercise files.
 <CODE><PRE>
    cd
    ./csc_get exercise5.tar
    tar xf exercise5.tar
    cd exercise5
    source setup.sh
 </PRE></code> 

This will provide ten simple C++ programs 
in files named "one.cpp" through
"ten.cpp".

To run the first one, do:

 <CODE><PRE>
   g++ -g2 one.cpp
   ./a.out
 </PRE></code> 

(The -g2 option ensures that debugging info is kept for later)
<p>
It should almost immediately print a result and quit:

 <CODE><PRE>
   % ./a.out 
   Hello World!
   Value is 1
   Done
   %
 </PRE></code> 

If you open the source file in your favorite editor, you'll
see that this is really simple code.

<p>
Programs two.cpp through ten.cpp all take slightly different approaches
and are meant to print similar, but not identical things.  Look through 
each of them and make a list of the answers to two questions for each one:
<ol>
<li>Are there any memory management errors in the program?
<li>Will it print the right results?
</ol>

Is it possible for both answers to be "yes"?
<p>
Once you have your list, run each of the programs and see 
if the program's results agree with your predictions.

<p>
Even if a memory error doesn't cause trouble for the printout
or prevent the program from terminating normally, we'd still like
to find them and fix them before they bite somebody else.
Doing it by inspecting the code is difficult, so we'd like
automated help.

<p>
First, we'll try the checks that the memory allocator can do on it's own.  
Do this:

<CODE><PRE>
   export MALLOC_CHECK_=1
</PRE></CODE>
(the underscores are important), or if you're using a C-style shell do:
<CODE><PRE>
   setenv MALLOC_CHECK_ 1
</PRE></CODE>

Now rerun each of the programs and figure out which errors are caught by this, and
which are not.  

<p>
malloc is only involved with allocation and return of memory, and generally
can't find problems with the actual memory references themselves.
valgrind, on the other hand, can check every memory reference if told to. 
We'll try that next.

<p>
First, turn off the malloc checking so it doesn't get in the way:
<CODE><PRE>
   export MALLOC_CHECK_=0
</PRE></CODE>
(the underscores are important), or if you're using a C-style shell do:
<CODE><PRE>
   setenv MALLOC_CHECK_ 0
</PRE></CODE>
(The setup scripts have already copied the necessary settings to your ~/.valgrindrc file)
<p>
Next, rerun each program under the scrutiny of valgrind:

 <CODE><PRE>
   g++ -g2 one.cpp
   valgrind ./a.out
 </PRE></code> 

Look at each output carefully to see what error(s) valgrind has found.  Did it find any that you missed?
Did it miss any that you found?
