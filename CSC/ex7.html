<h1>Exercise 7: Simple release activities</h1>
 
Reminder:  Look at 
&lt;<A HREF="http://server/jake/CSC/index.html">http://server/jake/CSC/index.html</a>&gt; 
for updates or corrections!
 
<P>
Goal: An introduction to a release build tool
<P>
First, create a local copy of the exercise files.

<CODE><PRE>
   cd
   tar xf ~jake/CSC/exercise7.tar
   cd exercise7
   source setup.sh
</PRE></code>
 
Now we'll create a very simple package, and explore its structure. We'll start by creating a "test" package, and version "v1-0" of it:
 
<CODE><PRE>
   cmt create test v1-0
</PRE></code>
 
This creates a "test" directory for the package, with a "v1-0" subdirectory for that version:
 
<CODE><PRE>
   ls test
   ls test/v1-0
   cd test/v1-0
</PRE></code>
 
To save typing, we've made some sample source files available to you. Copy them into your new project now (normally, you'd write these with an editor, etc; you may want to cut&paste the following line from the electronic version of these instructions):
 
<CODE><PRE>
   cp ~jake/CSC/exercise7/test/v1-0/*.* src/
</PRE></code>
 
You should look at these, but they're pretty straight-forward.  You also need to copy over the sample requirements file into the "cmt" control directory:
 
<CODE><PRE>
   cp ~jake/CSC/exercise7/test/v1-0/requirements cmt/
</PRE></code>
 
You should now look at that requirements file.  It contains three lines:

<CODE><PRE>
   package       test
   author        Vincent Garonne <garonne@lal.in2p3.fr>
   application   test main.cxx hello.cxx
</PRE></code>
 
The first one defines the name of the package; the second gives credit to the author.  It's the third line that controls the build, by telling CMT what it needs to know to build an "application" within this package.
<P> 
Now build and run this little program from the "cmt" directory within the version:

<CODE><PRE>
   cd cmt
   cmt make
   ../Linux-x86_64/test.exe
</PRE></code>

You should see "Hello world", indicating that this worked.  Take a few moments to look around the directory structure and see where things have been created. Using a "Linux-i686" directory for object and binary files allows you to use the same source directories to build for different types of machines.
<P>
Now, in addition to the executable, we want to create a library for the "Hello" class, but without the "main" program in the library.  CMT will again do this, we just have to tell it how by adding this line:
 
<CODE><PRE>
   library       hello   -no_share hello.cxx
</PRE></code>
 
to the requirements file.  Try that, remake the project, and check to make sure it's been built. (Where is it stored?  Why?)
<P>
Now we want to work with a pair of packages with a dependency. First, we create those:

<CODE><PRE>
   cd ~/exercise7
   cmt create A v1-0
   cmt create B v1-0
</PRE></code>
 
Next, copy in some source & requirements files (normally, you'd create these yourself):
 
<CODE><PRE>
  cp ~jake/CSC/exercise7/A/v1-0/*.* A/v1-0/src/
  cp ~jake/CSC/exercise7/A/v1-0/requirements A/v1-0/cmt/
  cp ~jake/CSC/exercise7/B/v1-0/*.* B/v1-0/src/
  cp ~jake/CSC/exercise7/B/v1-0/requirements B/v1-0/cmt/
</PRE></code>
 
Look at the header *.h and main.cc files for A (in A/v1-0/src)
and you'll see that the "A" package is complete by itself.
<p>
The "B" package depends on "A". Do you see where?
If we try to build without that A being available for B, the build will fail.
Try that:
<CODE><PRE>
   cd B/v1-0/cmt
   cmt make
</PRE></code>

CMT doesn't know that B depends on A:

<CODE><PRE>
   cmt show uses
</PRE></code>
 
To make sure the right things are built and searched, CMT needs to know that B depends on A.
There's a new line in B's requirements file to express this,
but it's commented out.  Note that it specifies the version to use:

<CODE><PRE>
#use A v1-0
</PRE></code>

Remove the #, so the line is no longer a comment, and try again.

<CODE><PRE>
   cmt show uses
</PRE></code>

We can now ask CMT to build everything for us. 
If will figure out that it needs to compile, across all packages, then make libraries, before linking:
 
<CODE><PRE>
  cmt broadcast make
</PRE></code>
 
The "broadcast" modifier means to "build everything".  Now run that program:
 
<CODE><PRE>
   ../Linux-x86_64/main.exe
</PRE></code>

Finally, edit the requirements file to refer to another version such as "v2-0", and remake the program. CMT will fail to find that version,  resulting in a cascade of errors.
