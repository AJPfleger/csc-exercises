<h1>Exercise 7: Simple release activities</h1>
 
Reminder:  Look at

<P>
Goal: An introduction to a release build tool
<P>
CMT is a simple, yet quite powerful, tool for putting together a series of
"packages" into a "release". As such, it's a good example of that first way
of working we talked about:  Create an organization with lots of people and subgroups
focused on individual components ("packages"), then have a central way of combining those
and creating specific "releases" at specific times.

<p>
In this exercise, we learn a little bit about how CMT does this.  We'll follow that
up later with more complicated examples to demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses 
of the approach.

<p>
If you haven't already installed CMT in your account, do the following:
(We do this so every machine is independent, and so you can run these
exercises later at home if you want; we provide versions for the most common
machine types, but if it doesn't run on your laptop see the 
<a href="install_cmt.html">page on doing a custom install</a>.)
<p>
<code><pre>
    cd
    ./csc_get cmt-dev-all.tgz
    tar xf cmt-dev-all.tgz
</pre></code>

<P>
To do the exercise, start by creating a local copy of the exercise files.

<CODE><PRE>
    cd
    ./csc_get exercise7.tar
    tar xf exercise7.tar
    ./csc_get exercise7extras.tar
    tar xf exercise7extras.tar
    cd exercise7
    source setup.sh
</PRE></code>
 
Now we'll create a very simple package, and explore its structure. 
We'll start by creating a "test" package, and version "v1-0" of it:
 
<CODE><PRE>
    cmt create test v1-0
</PRE></code>
 
This creates a "test" directory for the package, with a "v1-0" subdirectory for that version:
 
<CODE><PRE>
    ls test
    ls test/v1-0
    cd test/v1-0
</PRE></code>
 
To save typing, we've made some sample source files available to you. 
Copy them into your new project now (normally, you'd write these with an editor, etc; 
you may want to cut&paste the following line):
 
<CODE><PRE>
    cp ~/exercise7extras/test/v1-0/*.* src/
</PRE></code>
 
You should look at these, but they're pretty straight-forward.  
You also need to copy over the sample requirements file into the "cmt" control directory:
 
<CODE><PRE>
    cp ~/exercise7extras/test/v1-0/cmt/requirements cmt/
</PRE></code>
 
You should now look at that requirements file.  It contains three lines:

<CODE><PRE>
    package       test
    author        Vincent Garonne <garonne@lal.in2p3.fr>
    application   test main.cxx hello.cxx
</PRE></code>
 
The first one defines the name of the package; the second gives credit to the author.  
It's the third line that controls the build, by telling CMT what it needs to know 
to build an "application" within this package.
<P> 
Now build and run this little program from the "cmt" directory within the version:

<CODE><PRE>
    cd cmt
    cmt make
    ../${CMTCONFIG}/test.exe
</PRE></code>

You should see "Hello world", indicating that this worked.  
Take a few moments to look around the directory structure and see where things have been created. 
Using a "${CMTCONFIG}" directory for object and binary files allows you to use
the same source directories to build for different types of machines.
<P>
Now, in addition to the executable, 
we want to create a library for the "Hello" class, but without the "main" program in the library.  
CMT will again do this, we just have to tell it how by adding this line:
 
<CODE><PRE>
    library       hello   -no_share hello.cxx
</PRE></code>
 
to the requirements file.  Try that, remake the project, and check to make sure it's been built. 
(Where is it stored?  Why?)
<P>
Now we want to work with a pair of packages with a dependency. First, we create two separate packages:

<CODE><PRE>
    cd ~/exercise7
    cmt create A v1-0
    cmt create B v1-0
</PRE></code>
 
Next, copy in some source & requirements files (normally, you'd create these yourself):
 
<CODE><PRE>
    cp ~/exercise7extras/A/v1-0/*.*               A/v1-0/src/
    cp ~/exercise7extras/A/v1-0/cmt/requirements  A/v1-0/cmt/
    cp ~/exercise7extras/B/v1-0/*.*               B/v1-0/src/
    cp ~/exercise7extras/B/v1-0/cmt/requirements  B/v1-0/cmt/
</PRE></code>
 
Look at the header *.h and main.cc files for A (in A/v1-0/src)
and you'll see that the "A" package is complete by itself.
<p>
The "B" package depends on "A". Do you see where?
If we try to build without that A being available for B, the build will fail.
Try that:
<CODE><PRE>
    cd B/v1-0/cmt
    cmt make
</PRE></code>

CMT doesn't know that B depends on A:

<CODE><PRE>
    cmt show uses
</PRE></code>
 
To make sure the right things are built and searched, CMT needs to know that B depends on A.
There's a new line in B's requirements file to express this,
but it's commented out.  Note that it specifies the version to use:

<CODE><PRE>
    #use A v1-0
</PRE></code>

Remove the #, so the line is no longer a comment, and try again.

<CODE><PRE>
    cmt show uses
</PRE></code>

We can now ask CMT to build everything for us. 
If will figure out that it needs to compile across all packages, then make libraries, 
and then finally link any executables:
 
<CODE><PRE>
    cmt broadcast make
</PRE></code>
 
The "broadcast" modifier means to "build everything".  Now run that program:
 
<CODE><PRE>
    ../${CMTCONFIG}/main.exe
</PRE></code>

Finally, edit B's requirements file to refer to another version such as "v2-0", and remake the program. 
CMT will fail to find that version,  resulting in a cascade of errors.
