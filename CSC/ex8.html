<h1>Exercise 8: Releasing code as it changes</h1>
 
Reminder:  Look at 
&lt;<A HREF="index.html">the index page</a>&gt; 
for updates or corrections!
 
<P>
Goal: Dealing with dependencies using a release tool.
<P>
First, create a local copy of the exercise files.
 
<CODE><PRE>
   cd
   tar xf ~jake/CSC/exercise8.tar
   cd exercise8
   source setup.sh
</PRE></code>

This will create CMT directories for seven packages, named A through G.  
Each of those will have separate versions. 
Drop down to version 1-0 of G and check the dependencies:

<CODE><PRE>
   cd G/v1-0/cmt
   cmt show uses
</PRE></code>
 
You'll see that G depends on version v1-0 of all of A through F (and B still depends on A, as in exercise7).
Check the G.h and G.cxx files to see why that's true.  Then ask CMT to build everything needed:
 
<CODE><PRE>
   cmt broadcast make
</PRE></code>

Note that CMT does seven build operations:  
It builds version v1-0 of the A through G packages, 
but not any of the other versions, because they're not needed (yet). 
Run the program:

<CODE><PRE>
   ../Linux-i686/main.exe
</PRE></code>

It should display a line from each of the seven libraries.  Success!
<P>
Now we're going to simulate the various issues that can arise as you try to "release" consistent sets of code.  
First, note that you've got a working combination here.  The "requirements" file for G lists a set of versions that works.
<P>
Unfortunately, there's a problem with v1-0 of the D package; 
it's printing the wrong thing, and you've detected that during your testing.
The owner of the package has provided a "v1-1" version that has this fixed. 
Make the necessary changes to your G requirements file, rebuild,
and see if you've really fixed it.  
(You are not to change the .h or .cxx files in this exercise; pretend they're too complicated to figure out right now)
<P>
You've now got a working "v1" of G and the libraries it uses, which you could bundle up and distribute.
<P>
Unfortunately, as the system gets bigger and bigger, having G depend on everything becomes impractical.  
So we need to iteratively evolve this system so that G just depends on F, which does some of the work and relies on E, etc.
<P>
We decide to do this in a "Version 2" of the system. (One of the hardest 
parts is getting all the changes made for a big update like this; we'll skip
over what it takes to get the package programmers to do this...)

<CODE><PRE>
    cd ~/exercise8/G/v2-0/cmt
</PRE></code>

Look at the version v2-0 G.cxx, F.cxx, etc files to see a way that 
the packages could be decoupled
(there are other, more robust ways to do it, but this will serve for now).  
Briefly, where the main program in package G used to directly invoke
everything
<code><pre>
int main()
{
    A a;
    B b;
    C c;
    D d;
    E e;
    F f;
    G g;
    
    a.print ();
    b.print ();
    c.print ();
    d.print ();
    e.print ();
    f.print ();
    g.print ();

    return 0;
}

void G::print ()
{
        F f;
        f.print();
        cout&lt;&lt;"Hello from G"&lt;&lt;endl;
}

</pre></code>
now it just invokes F, which in turn will invoke E, that will invoke D, etc:
<code><pre>
void G::print ()
{
        F f;
        f.print();
        cout&lt;&lt;"Hello from G"&lt;&lt;endl;
}
</pre></code>
The programmers have provided the updated .h and .cxx files, 
but they've not all updated their dependencies 
in the various requirements files.  
If you try to build this now, it will fail because the compiler can't find
needed pieces (you can try this if you'd like to see what it looks like)
<P>
Your next task will be to update those 
requirements files so that you can build this.
We've done G (which only depends on F), and A, B, C and D.  
E should depend on D, 
F should depend on E; you'll have to make those changes.

<CODE><PRE>
    (edit v2-0/cmt/requirements files as needed; see above)
    cd ~/exercise8/G/v2-0/cmt
    cmt broadcast make
</PRE></code> 

You may need to do the "make" several times.  If things get too messed up, you can say

<CODE><PRE>
   cmt broadcast make clean
</PRE></code> 

to clean things up. When you get it to build properly, you should be able to say

<CODE><PRE>
    ../Linux-i686/main.exe
    cmt show uses
</PRE></code> 

to run the program and show the usage tree respectively.
<P>
Note two things about your solution: 
<ol>
<LI>Since the dependencies in the code changed, the requirements files in each package had to change too.
It makes sense for the people who are working on the code to also maintain the requirements file!
<LI>The G package now depends on only F, not anything else. 
(If you have anything else in the G/v2-0/cmt/requirements file, you should remove them and try again)
</ol>

Unfortunately, the D package didn't get enough unit testing, so v2-0 of it has the same spelling problem that v1-0 had.  
Next, you're to fix that by using the new v2-1 version of D.  (Again, don't change the code itself)
<P>
Which requirements file do you need to change to fix this?
<P>
Make the change, and confirm that the program really does produce the right output.
Use the CMT "show uses" command to look at the new dependencies.
