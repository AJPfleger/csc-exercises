<h1>Exercise 9: Managing configuration conflicts</h1>
 
Reminder:  Look at 
&lt;<A HREF="index.html">the index page</a>&gt; 
for updates or corrections!

<P>
Goal: One of the hardest things to do in large systems is to migrate interfaces. 
We'll practice that here, and get some experience with why it's hard.
<P> 
First, create a local copy of the exercise files.
<CODE><PRE>
    cd
    ./csc_get exercise9.tar
    tar xf exercise9.tar
    cd exercise9
    source setup.sh
</PRE></code> 
 
This will create CMT directories for four packages:  Base, User1, User2, Main.  
Each of those will have separate versions. Drop down to version 1-0 of Main and check the dependencies:
<CODE><PRE>
   cd Main/v1-0/cmt
   cmt show uses
</PRE></code> 
 
Think of Base as some basic library to do logging.  
In this case, that logging is just printing to the terminal, 
but in large system controlling logging can be a key issue. 
User1 and User2 are other libraries that use the Base library, 
and Main as a primary executable that needs User1 and User2 to do its work.
<P>  
We've provided a v1-0 for all these that is ready to go.  
Take a look at them to see how the various packages use each other. 
Then ask CMT to build everything needed:
<CODE><PRE>
   cmt broadcast make
</PRE></code> 
 
Note that cmt does four build operations, ending with a link. Run the program:
<CODE><PRE>
   ../${CMTCONFIG}/main.exe
</PRE></code> 
 
It should display lines that each of Main, User1 and User2 have requested Base to print.  
Success!
<P>  
There's also a version v2-0 of Base.  
It provides a more complicated logging interface.  
Unfortunately, as the version number seems to indicate, it's not backward compatible with version v1-0. 
Even though that v2-0 of Base is present, when we ran the code above, we hadn't built it in.  
We got a running system, but not the new features of Base.  
(Take a look at v2-0 of Base to see how the printout would have been different)
<p>
The User1 team is really excited about these features, and has provided a new version v2-0 of User1 that uses them.  
(They've even provided the requirements file!) Your job is to create a version v2-0 of Main that uses v2-0 of User1 
and produces a working executable.  
We've provided Main v2-0, but you'll need to (at least) update its requirements file.

<CODE><PRE>
   cd ~/exercise9/Main/v2-0/cmt
   (edit the requirements file)
   cmt broadcast make clean
   cmt broadcast make
</PRE></code> 

Note that you get messages about inconsistent versions (look for them!), 
even though the build runs to completion.
Those messages will be more obvious if you ask CMT to show you the versions used:
<CODE><PRE>
   cmt show uses
</PRE></code> 

<p>
Try running the newly-linked version, and see if does what the User1 and User2 groups expect:
<CODE><PRE>
   ../${CMTCONFIG}/main.exe
</PRE></code> 

<p>
First, what do you expect to see?  Do you expect that the call by User1 to the new routine in Base will
work or fail?  That the call by User2 to the old routine in Base will work or fail?

<p>
You should see something a little unexpected:

<code><pre>
User1 invokes the logging
Log: logged by Base1 at severity 3 (from Base v2-0) 
User2 invokes the logging
Log: logged by User2 (from Base v2-0) 
</pre></code>

<u>Both</u> calls succeeded!  But somehow both also claim to be coming from the "Base v2-0" code!

<p>
Take a look at the .cxx and .h files to see if you can understand why this is happening.
If you have questions, flag down Bob and talk to him about it.

<p>
Even though it's wrong in an unexpected way, it's still wrong.
What do you have to do to fix this?
<p>
Try to think of at least two ways to correct this problem so you're building a consistent version. 
What are they advantages and disadvantages of each approach? 
(Bob will give you hints if you can't think of more than one approach)
Are any of these really satisfactory?  
What's really the underlying problem?  
Hint: It's not just configuration management, though that's part of the solution.
