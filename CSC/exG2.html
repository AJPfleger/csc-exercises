<h1>Exercise G2: Branching and Merging</h1>
 
Reminder:  Look at

for updates or corrections!
 
<P>
Goal: Gain familiarity branches and merges

<p>
This exercise works in a slightly different way than the
<a href="exG1.html">previous one</a>,
which you should have completed first if you're not already familiar with
Git. To reduce the amount of typing involved, we've got a 
<a href="exG2script.sh">shell script</a> 
for you to run that does the typing. It periodically stops to allow you to check the results in a
separate window.

<h3>Basic Operations</h3>

If you haven't done it already, you have to tell Git who you are:

<code><pre>
    git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"    
</pre></code>
Next, create a work area:

<code><pre>
    cd
    mkdir exerciseG2
    cd exerciseG2/
</pre></code>
Then run the script:

<code><pre>
    /home/jake/CSC/exG2script.sh
</pre></code>
It will create a new repository for you, then stop.  
<p>
Open another window in which to check things, and in that do:
  
<code><pre>
    cd ~/exerciseG2
    gitk --all &
    gitg &
</pre></code>

To get the best display on gitg, select the "history" tab and then select "All Branches" from the "Branch" box.
<p>
Now hit "enter" or "return" to step through the script one section at a time.  At each pause,
<ul>
<li>look at what commands the script has executed
<li>look at the contents.txt file 
<li>look at the gitk and gitg displays (don't forget to refresh!) to see how the repository structure changes 
<li>and maybe do some <code>git log</code> or other commands to see the details.  
</ul>
Some brief summary 
information is below.  

<p>
The goal here is to understand how branches can be created, how 
you move back and forth between them, and how the merging process works.

<ul>
<li>First the repository is created.  After this, git commands will work and
    gitk will have a repository to display.
<li>Two commits on master show how it grows in the simplest possible case.
<li>Branch A_dev is created and two commits are done on it. What is the master 
    branch doing while this is happening?
<li>Shows how to transition back to the master branch with a single command,
    then make a change there.
<li>B creates a branch, but doesn't switch to it or use it
<li>Still on the master, another commit.  What are the branches doing now?
<li>And now B is working on the B_dev branch.  What is A_dev doing?
<li>Two more commits on the master branch. Note that both B_dev and 
    master have changes since they were last in contact. How can 
    they be combined?
<li>B wanted to merge those changes on the master branch onto her development (B_dev)
    branch so keep it up to date. They conflicted, and that had to be managed.
    Master unchanged.
<li>B does a little more work.
<li>B brings her branch back onto master for others to appreciate.
    Note this doesn't require a merge, and leaves B_dev containing
    nothing that's not in the master.
<li>So finally that branch goes away.
</ul>


Would definitely be interested in hearing whether this follow-along method
works better or worse than the cut&paste in other exercises!
