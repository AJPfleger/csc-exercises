<h1>Exercise G3: Distributed Development</h1>
 
Reminder: If there's been a correction to this exercise posted, 
update your local copy via
<A HREF="index.html#corrections">these instructions</a>
before proceeding.
 
<P>
Goal: Gain familiarity with distributed, parallel 
development using Git.

<p>
If you haven't done it already, you have to tell Git who you are:

<code><pre>
    git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"    
</pre></code>

We're going to create a master repository, and a separate
developer work area.  First, we create your own copy of a 
master repository.  This is just a copy of the repository 
build in <a href="exG2.html">exercise G2</a>.

<code><pre>
    cd
    ./csc_get exG3script.sh
    ./csc_get exG3MasterRepo.tar
    tar xf exG3MasterRepo.tar
</pre></code>

Next, create a work area:

<code><pre>
    cd
    mkdir exerciseG3A
    cd exerciseG3A/
</pre></code>

You're going to be a "remote" developer called "A".
(Later, we'll have another called "B")
To start, 
you clone your own copy of the repository:

<code><pre>
    git clone ../exG3MasterRepo.git .
</pre></code>
    
Take a look.  You've now got a repository in .git, and Git
has checked out that current HEAD of that repository.  Explore it
a little with <code>git log</code> and <code>gitk --all</code> to if it looks like you expect.

<p>
To make it easier to see who is who later on, we'll change our 
name in this repository (no --global option)
<code><pre>
    git config user.name "Developer A"    
</pre></code>
<p>
One difference that's easily visible in gitk is that, in addition to the "master" branch, 
you've now got a "remotes/origin/master" branch.  The first is your local repository,
and the second came from the original repository.  That original repository is "remote", which 
means "not here".  
The repository from which yours was cloned is by default called "origin". 
"master" is the name of the branch inside it. See
the convention? You should also see a remotes/origin/A_dev branch and now understand what that is.
<P>
If you commit a change, what should happen within the repository? Do the branch flags move
in the display?

<code><pre>
    echo 'Commit on end of local master' >> contents.txt
    git add contents.txt
    git commit -m'Commit on end of local master'
</pre></code>

Refresh gitk and notice that there master branch has moved on, leaving 
that remotes/origin/master back where it was. Do a couple more just to 
make it easy to see what's going on:
    
<code><pre>
    echo 'Commit on end of local master' >> contents.txt
    git add contents.txt
    git commit -m'Commit on end of local master'

    echo 'Commit on end of local master' >> contents.txt
    git add contents.txt
    git commit -m'Commit on end of local master'
</pre></code>

OK, let's say these are a useful fix.  How can we get them back into the main 
repository so somebody else can see them?
<p>
The simplest way is to "push" the content to the main repository.
This requires that you be able to write to the repository, that you're trusted
to make decisions about what and when to update, etc. This is the way SVN and CVS repositories are
often used, with a number of people able to make changes anywhere.
<p>
If the project is set up like that, you can move your repository contents
back to the main one with:

<code><pre>
    git push 
</pre></code>
    
This moved all the content on the current branch up to the main repository.
(<code>git push --all</code> moves all changes on all branches, not just the current branch.)
<p> 
Note that it also moved the 
remotes/origin/master branch forward to agree with your current master branch.
That's reflecting the change in the main repository.  You can 
look at the main repository to see the changes:

<code><pre>
    cd ../exG3MasterRepo.git/
    gitk --all
</pre></code>

Some projects use a model where central people "fetch" or "pull" changes
from the individual developers.  You let them know when you have something
ready, perhaps via email or a web form, and when they're ready they
tell Git to copy your commits from your repository back to the central one.
We'll talk a little bit more about the "fetch" and "pull" process below.

<h3>Multiple Developers</h3>

Now let's see how two developers can interact.  We'll create
a working area for somebody else, "B":

<code><pre>
    cd
    mkdir exerciseG3B
    cd exerciseG3B/
</pre></code>

and get another clone of the repository

<code><pre>
    git clone ../exG3MasterRepo.git .
</pre></code>

We'll change our 
name in this repository (no --global option) with

<code><pre>
    git config user.name "Developer B"    
</pre></code>

We'll make a couple changes and push them back:

<code><pre>
    echo 'Commit on end of B local master' >> contents.txt
    git add contents.txt
    git commit -m'Commit on end of B local master'

    echo 'Commit on end of B local master' >> contents.txt
    git add contents.txt
    git commit -m'Commit on end of B local master'

    git push
</pre></code>
    
Look at both B's repository and the main (common) repository
with gitk, and you'll see the new commits there.
<p>
If you check developer A's repository, though, you don't see them.

<code><pre>
    cd
    cd exerciseG3A/
    gitk --all
</pre></code>
    
They won't appear until A asks for them.  To see what that involves, 
add another change to A's work:

<code><pre>
    echo 'Commit on end of A local master' >> contents.txt
    git add contents.txt
    git commit -m'Commit on end of A local master'
</pre></code>

This will conflict with B's work.  That doesn't alway happen, but 
when it does, we have to manage it.
<p>
While we have this situation, what happens if A tries to push
changes back while B's are at the front of the master branch in
the main repository?  Well, what do you think should happen?
Once you've decided, try it:

<code><pre>
    git push
</pre></code>
    
The operation is rejected, and you get a message explaining why.
<p>
There are (basically) two ways to get back to a consistent state 
by bring the changes into A's repository:

<ul>
<li><code>git fetch</code> copies the commits in, but doesn't try to merge them
yet.  You do that manually.
<li><code>git pull</code> copies the commits in, and then does the merge as far as it
can, leaving conflicts for you.
</ul>

In general, if you think there are no conflicts, <code>git pull</code> is easiest.  
But it tends to be confusing where there are conflicts, so many people are in the 
habit of always doing it in two steps:  First <code>git fetch</code>, then
<code>git merge</code>.
<p>
To see this work,

<code><pre>
    git fetch
</pre></code>
    
and look with <code>gitk --all</code> at what you'd got. You should see that 
"master" and "remotes/origin/master" are on two separate sections of the tree.
To fix that, you merge "remotes/origin/master" onto your current work:

<code><pre>
    git merge remotes/origin/master
</pre></code>
    
As expected, this declares a conflict, which you have to fix and manually commit:

<code><pre>
    (edit)
    git add contents.txt 
    git commit -m"fix merge with main repo"
</pre></code>
    
Now you can push it back:

<code><pre>
    git push
</pre></code>
    
and all is well.

<p>
There's nothing special about the main repository.  You can "push" or "pull" from
any to any Git repository, so long as you have write access to the destination.
Git can work with both local and remote (using several protocols) repositories, 
so there are lots of possible ways to operate.
<p>
For example, if A and B are cooperating on a complicated change, they can push/pull
commits back and forth between them until they're both happy, and only then 
put them back into the main repository.  This is a very powerful way of making sure that 
the main repository stays clean and useful during rapid development.


<h3>Branches and Distributed Development</h3>

It can be tricky to have
everybody working on the
master branch when there are a lot of people working.  
Contributed changes
have to get committed and pushed back to the master branch in the main 
repository to be in common use, so there's a 
lot of activity there.  
That can collide with your own work as
you try to write your own changes.
<p>
It's often better to use Git's cheap and fast branches for your work.
You can put each of your current efforts into a branch of it's own,
have other little branches for considering different approaches,
and then only keep the one(s) that really work out.
<p>
For example, let's consider developer A who's working on a 
project in the A_dev branch.  There's a bunch of changes and
a couple things to try.  We'll boil that effort down to a script you 
can run that makes the changes:
<code><pre>
    cd ~/exerciseG3A
    ~/exG3script.sh
</pre></code>

Take a look at it with gitk to see all the various bits.  
Developer A is done
now, and just wants to publish what's on A_dev itself.
<p>
Developer A tells the central maintainer, who just has to fetch that particular branch from A's 
repository, and then merge it on to the master branch there.
<p>
To do that:
<code><pre>
    cd ~/exG3MasterRepo.git
    git fetch ../exerciseG3A/ A_dev:New_from_A_dev
</pre></code>

The git fetch command specifies the repository (often a name or URL, but here
it's a directory location), the name of the branch to be pulled ("A_dev") and
what to call it here ("New_from_A_dev").  Once it's in, it can be tested, and 
eventually merged.

<h3>Telling a Story</h3>

In large projects, it's very useful for the repository to 
tell a simple story about where the code came from.  
You might make dozens of commits and use lots of branches to try
various options in your local repository, but when your final 
product goes back to the main project, that's all just noise 
and complexity.  You want to send in just one commit that
embodies your new contributions.  Git lets you do this.
<p>
First, you can drop dead-end branches in your development.
Not every idea works out!  To do this:

<code><pre>
    cd ~/exerciseG3A
    git branch -D A_dev_dumb_idea
    git branch -D A_dev_an_idea
    git branch -D A_dev_another_idea
</pre></code>

The "-D", instead of the "-d" we used earlier, is because these
branches haven't been merged in.  Deleting them will lose changes, but
here you're sure these aren't needed.
<p>
Now we're just left with branches that have a lot of commits.
<p>
The "rebase" Git command has a lot of uses. Basically,
it allows you to merge or move commits around in the repository
tree.  This can get you into trouble, but it can also be 
powerful.
<p>
Here, we're just going to use it to collapse a number of 
commits into a single one.
<p>
Say you did 6 commits, and nobody pulled a copy of your repository
or created a (still-existing) branch in the middle.  You could have 
done all those changes in a single commit, right?  (If there's a 
branch out of the middle of them, you couldn't, so that's a more complex case)
But you didn't know at the time how many it would take until you were done, and
you wanted to keep your code safe in the repository, so you committed early and often.
<p>
Git rebase lets you go back and fix that.
The command looks like this:

<code><pre> 
    git checkout A_dev_bright_idea
    git rebase -i HEAD~6
</pre></code>  

The first line is just to make sure we're on the right branch for the example.
The "rebase" command has several formats, and -i says we want to use it 
interactively.  The HEAD~6 means that we want to act on the HEAD commit of the current
branch and the 6 commits leading up to that.  
<p>
Git pops an editor with a window that initially contains:

<code><pre>
pick 61b61d5 A_dev commit 1
pick 95247fb A_dev commit 2
pick 57c55d8 A_dev commit 3
pick c942bd3 A_dev bright idea
pick 5edb630 A_dev bright idea 2
pick ff3b151 A_dev bright idea 3

# Rebase 06e5a58..ff3b151 onto 06e5a58
#
# Commands:
#  p, pick = use commit
#  r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
#  e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
#  s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
#  f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
#  x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
</pre></code>

You see the 6 most recent commits we asked for, their ID numbers, and their comments.
(The ID numbers might be different for you.)
<p>
The "pick" at the front can be changed to one of the commands in the comment.
We want to keep that first commit, but "squash" the other 5 onto it so they all look like just one 
commit.
So change the first few lines to look like:
<code><pre>
pick 61b61d5 A_dev commit 1
squash 95247fb A_dev commit 2
squash 57c55d8 A_dev commit 3
squash c942bd3 A_dev bright idea
squash 5edb630 A_dev bright idea 2
squash ff3b151 A_dev bright idea 3
</pre></code>
save and exit the editor normally.  Git will pop another window with the 
6 comments in it, so you can combine them into the single commit message that 
will go with the combined commit.  Do that, save and exit normally.
<p>
Git will work for a second, and they you're done.  Take a look at the new tree
with gitk and see how clean it looks now.  And you got to rewrite the comment to say
exactly what your colleages need to know about all this!

<h3>Pull Requests</h3>

In some cases, you want to contribute code, but you don't have direct write 
access to the main repository. 
<p>
In the past, you'd be told to send in your contribution as a "patch", typically
a long text file containing lots of 'diff' output that can be used to add and remove
lines from files.  It can be a real pain to handle these in a consistent way, because a
diff-format patch is very unforgiving of the exact starting version of the file, 
character coding issues, etc.
<p>
Git is focused on the content of files, not the differences between them, 
so it works in a different way.
<p>
With Git, you make your changes in your own copy of the repository.  
The changed file(s) are there, along with lots of historical tracking information.  
You submit a "pull request" to somebody who has write access to the main repository.
They then use git tools to <em>pull</em> your entire set of changes from your
local repository, look it over to make sure it's OK, and merge it into the main development
in the main repository.

<p>
Git allows this process to be highly automated. 
The <a href="http://github.com">GitHub site</a> 
does it with a single click of a button. (See 
<a href="exF.html">exercise F</a> for more on this)
To help you understand it, we're going to walk through the details manually here.

<p>
First, let's create a branch in our local repository, and add a new file:
<code><pre>
% git branch pr-test
% git checkout pr-test
Switched to branch 'pr-test'

% cat &gt;PullExample.txt &lt;&lt;EOF
? This is the new content
? that we'll submit as a pull request.
? EOF

% git status
% git add PullExample.txt 
% git commit -m"new file for pull request"
</pre></code>

That puts the file in our repository.
<p>
Now, we create a "pull request" that we'll send to somebody with write access.
It looks like this:
<code><pre>
$ git request-pull master $PWD
The following changes since commit 0dc16c1e72569018adb7ddd3df6759d9aaceb0b7:

  Commit 6 on master (2013-08-18 18:11:19 +0300)

are available in the git repository at:

  /home/cscuser/exerciseG3A pr-test

for you to fetch changes up to fe515cfa5686728d55dd9fe428c72508f01effef:

  new file for pull request (2015-09-13 13:05:58 +0300)

----------------------------------------------------------------
CSC User (1):
      new file for pull request

 PullExample.txt | 3 +++
 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 PullExample.txt
</pre></code>

The two arguments are the branch (or tag, more often) where we started our 
work from, and how to access the repository.  That second one is often specified
as an externally-visible URL because it's how the person doing the pull will
access your changes.  Here, since we're working on one computer, it's just a 
file pathname.

<p>
Normally, you just copy that information into an email and send it off.
But let's look at it more closely.  The first lines
<code><pre>
The following changes since commit 0dc16c1e72569018adb7ddd3df6759d9aaceb0b7:

  Commit 6 on master (2013-08-18 18:11:19 +0300)

</pre></code>
provide a machine-readable (the 40 character hash code) and person readable (the commit
message and time) identity for where the work started.
The next part says where to find the repository with the changes, including
the branch within the repository.  
And the third part
<code><pre>
for you to fetch changes up to fe515cfa5686728d55dd9fe428c72508f01effef:

  new file for pull request (2015-09-13 13:05:58 +0300)

----------------------------------------------------------------
CSC User (1):
      new file for pull request

 PullExample.txt | 3 +++
 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 PullExample.txt
</pre></code>
tells you what to pull, and gives you a preview of what it should look like.

<p>
To merge this into the main repository (or any other repository, really:  You
might want to have somebody pull it and look at it to help you solve a problem),
git pulls across complete files.  Note that it doesn't make any attempt to patch files, 
or work out file differences, or anything like that: The information above is enough
for it to pull out just the needed parts from your repository, and put them into 
somebody else's.

<p>
Let's pretend to be somebody with write access to another copy of the repository.
First, get set for that:

<code><pre>
    cd
    mkdir exerciseG3C
    cd exerciseG3C
    git clone ../exG3MasterRepo.git .
</pre></code>

Use gitk or gitg to look at that, and you'll see that your
"new file for pull request" change isn't there yet, as you'd expect.
<p>
Now we pull it in using the information from the change request:

<code><pre>
$ git pull  /home/cscuser/exerciseG3A/.git/ pr-test
remote: Counting objects: 6, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.
From /home/cscuser/exerciseG3A/
 * branch            pr-test    -> FETCH_HEAD
Updating 0dc16c1..fe515cf
Fast-forward
 PullExample.txt | 3 +++
 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 PullExample.txt
</pre></code>

The <code>git pull</code> command takes its arguments right from the 
information that the request-pull command generated:  The repository (which 
would usually be a URL) and the branch.  It pulls that in and does the merge.
<p>
With big projects, people will sometimes for a "git fetch" first, check the changes, 
then do a "git merge" if everything is OK.  For simplicity, we did them together as "git pull"
here.
<p>
Use gitk or gitg to look at how it was merged in.
<p>
How is this process (somebody else doing a "git pull") different from you making the 
change with a "git push"?  It's about who gets to decide.  The "git pull" process allows
a small number of people, sometimes called "maintainers", to organize the flow of changes 
into a central repository.  They can check for consistency and quality. 
The can improve communications by passing the
pull requests around to others who are working on similar parts of the code.
The can pull onto the main <code>master</code> branch if the change is ready for publishing,
or onto another development branch if it needs more work or is waiting for another part.
<p>
In general, the maintainers are the ones who make sure that the main branch of 
development is always ready to go. That's a very powerful approach, because it combines
the ability of machines to test that "this is always working" with the ability of 
people to think about the changes in a systematic, collaborative way.
