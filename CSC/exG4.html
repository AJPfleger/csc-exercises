<P>
Goal: Gain familiarity with basic Git use

<p>
Some resources you may want to refer to later on:
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/">detailed git documentation</a>.
<li>Lots of <a href="http://gitready.com">questions and answers</a> on Git usage.
<li>A writeup on how to <a href="http://git.or.cz/course/svn.html">onvert your SVN thinking</a> to Git.
</ul>

<p>
Reminder of convention:  Commands in <code>code font</code> are meant to 
be cut and pasted into a command line:
<code><pre>
    cd
    echo "Done!"
</pre></code>
When we want to show the output from a command, we'll include the command prompt:
<code><pre>
$date
Thu June 15 10:37:13 PDT 2015
</pre></code>
That's not meant to be cut & pasted in it's entirety, just the parts 
after the $ or % command prompt.
