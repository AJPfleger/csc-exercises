Goal: Gain familiarity with basic CMake use

<h3>CMake from Scratch</h3>

In this section, we walk you through the very, very basics of how
CMake builds code by adjusting to your local environment.
<p>
Create your workspace:
 <CODE><PRE>
    cd
    ./csc_get exerciseM1.tar
    tar xf exerciseM1.tar
    cd exerciseM1
    source setup.sh
 </PRE></code> 


This provides two files:
<ul>
<li>HelloWorld.cxx - small hello-world C++ program
<li>CMakeLists.txt - information for CMake
</ul>

Take a look at the CMakeLists.txt file.  It's got two things in it:
<ul>
<li><code>PROJECT(hello CXX)</code> - name this project, and say it's in C++
<li><code>ADD_EXECUTABLE(hello.exe HelloWorld.cxx)</code> - The desired result 
        is an executable named hello.exe made from the HelloWorld.cxx file.
</ul>

Tell CMake to process that file with:
 <CODE><PRE>
    cmake .
 </PRE></code> 
(Note the dot: you have to tell CMake which directory to work with, in this case the current directory.
If you don't do that, CMake just describes itself and quits without doing anything.)
<p>
CMake hasn't built the result yet.  CMake never does build it.  
Rather, it creates
the files needed for the native build process on your machine, in this case a Makefile.
Take a look at that, but don't worry about understanding all of it.  
CMake creates a lot of structure in the Makefile
for its own purposes.
<p>
To do the actual build:

 <CODE><PRE>
    make
 </PRE></code> 

and then to run it:

 <CODE><PRE>
    ./hello.exe
 </PRE></code> 

OK, it's not much.  <code>g++ HelloWorld.cxx ; ./a.out</code> will produce
the same output.  But this is laying the groundwork for being able to build
automatically.  
For example:  How did you know to use g++ vs clang vs something else
for the compiler?  CMake worked that out for you.

<h3>Adding Structure to Code</h3>

Where CMake starts to shine is large builds.  We want to organize larger projects
into sub-parts, with libraries, etc.  

<P>
To see this, we create and populate a new directory:

 <CODE><PRE>
   cd
   ./csc_get exerciseM1A.tar
   tar xf exerciseM1A.tar
   cd exerciseM1A
 </PRE></code> 

This contains two subdirectories:
<ul>
<li>Hello - the hello world code, now to create a library for reuse
<li>Test - source for a small executable to test the Hello class
</ul>

This is about the smallest possible structured project.  Try building the library 
and test executable manually, then running it, to get a good feel for 
how it's already getting complicated.  How many steps and minutes did it take
you to get it running?

<p>
CMake processes this via a CMakeLists.txt
in the top directory and each of the subdirectories.  Take a look at those
and try to understand what they say.
<UL>
<li>The top level one just tells CMake that that are two subdirectories to 
process.  It does this as part of single pass through the entire project;
it doesn't spin off a new CMake process as make does, for example.
<P>
<li>The CMakeLists.txt in the Hello directory tells CMake to create a library
for the Hello directory.
<p>
<li>The CMakeLists.txt in the Test directory is a little more complex.  It
has to specify where to find the include (.h) file and the library for 
Hello.  It then says that an executable is to be built, and linked
to a library.  This sequence will become platform-specific instructions, 
in this case a Makefile.
</UL>
<p>
Note how variables like ${HELLO_SOURCE_DIR} are used to hold information
on where things can be found.  This is a 
general mechanism that we'll explore more below.
<p>
Run CMake to see what it does:

 <CODE><PRE>
    cmake .
 </PRE></code> 

Note that it creates multiple Makefiles.  Take a look at them to see how they're
related (if you like reading Make syntax anyway)

<p>
Finally, you can do the actual build:
 <CODE><PRE>
    make
 </PRE></code> 
(you can do <code>make clean</code> if you want to go back to the start
and repeat the <code>make</code> process)

<p>
Together, CMake and make have figured out the exact commands needed to build this
code, and executed them with minimal intellectual effort on your part.
<p>
Also note that CMake started with a complete, consistent set of code.
CMake is reasoning about how to combine source code versions; you've already done
that in the code repository and checked out (or downloaded) what you want to build.
CMake just takes on the job of building that code.

<p>
The ability to insert targeted test executables into the build process is
very important for large projects.  
See the <code>ENABLE_TESTING()</code> and <code>ADD_TEST()</code>
commands in the CMake documentation for more information.

<h3>A Bit on Syntax</h3>

The CMakeLists.txt files use a specific syntax.  You can
find a
<a href="http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/manual/cmake-language.7.html#syntax">full description on the web</a>. 

<p>
To get a little feel for that, we'll add a little bit to the top-level
CMakeLists.txt file.  
 
<CODE><PRE>
cd ~/exerciseM1A
cat &lt;&lt; EOF  &gt;&gt;CMakeLists.txt

# How to show a simple message
message("saying Hello World from CMake")

# doing conditional processing of variables
if (UNIX)
  set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "\${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -fexceptions -g -Wall")
  message("Setting GCC flags" \${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS})
else()
  set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "\${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} /EHc-")
  message("Setting non-Unix flags" \${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS})
endif()
EOF

</PRE></code> 

Rerunning the "cmake ." command will then produce some output.
It is possible to build architecture-specific processing
into CMake if it's really needed, but it's generally considered 
good practice to minimize this.


<h3>Finding Libraries and Installed Components</h3>

You've seen a bit about how CMake keeps track of the parts that it builds.
The other thing that's needed is the ability to 
locate and use external libraries and other components that
have been installed on the computer independently of CMake.
<p>
Let's assume that we want to find and use the Git
libraries in our code. We add a 

<CODE><PRE>
cd ~/exerciseM1A
cat &lt;&lt; EOF  &gt;&gt;CMakeLists.txt
# Locate installed Git and set path variables
find_package(Git REQUIRED)
# Show Git path variable
message("GIT_EXECUTABLE set to:  " \${GIT_EXECUTABLE})
EOF
cmake .
</PRE></code> 

You'll see that the <code>find_package()</code>
call locates the Git installation, and updates
variables that can be used to reference the package.
(Or, you might find an error message if your
machine isn't set up with Git, in which case you should just proceed on this exercise anyway)
<p>
To get more information on a package such as use:
<CODE><PRE>
cmake --help-module FindGit
</PRE></code>
The conventions the variable names aren't 100% followed,
so when linking to a new component library you need to do
this to find out the right ones.
<p>
CMake uses "modules" as customization plug-ins.
"Find" modules are a special case that make the 
<code>find_package</code> system work.
To see all the ones available on your computer, 
do
<CODE><PRE>
cmake --help-module-list
</PRE></code>
To see more examples of a module description,

<CODE><PRE>
cmake --help-module FindX11
cmake --help-module FindBoost
</PRE></code>

<p>
So now you have the tools to get CMake
to handle all the machine-specific aspects of building 
your code.  You can bundle up source and a few CMakeLists.txt files
and distribute them via your source control system.  At the destination
computer, CMake will create the necessary parts to build, and
the local build system will create the needed parts.
