<h1>Exercise M2: CMake and Larger Builds</h1>
 
Reminder:  Look at 
&lt;<A HREF="index.html">the index page</a>&gt; 
for updates or corrections!
 
<P>
Goal: Gain familiarity with how CMake handles larger structures


<p>
In the prior exercise, you saw how
CMake handles all the machine-specific aspects of building 
your code.  You can bundle up source and a few CMakeLists.txt files
and distribute them via your source control system.  At the destination
computer, CMake will create the necessary parts to build, and
the local build system will create the needed parts.

<p>
This allows the consistency of the system to be enforced in the 
source control system, with CMake entering downstream from that. 
We play with that in this exercise.

<h3>A Naive Larger Build</h3>

In this section, we're going to 
create a sample project with 
subparts A through G.  
G includes a test program that 
runs all of that code.
<p>
First, we create and populate a new directory:

 <CODE><PRE>
   cd
   ./csc_get exerciseM2.tar
   tar xf exerciseM2.tar
   cd exerciseM2
   source setup.sh
 </PRE></code> 

Take a look at each at the contents of
the A through F directories (not G yet!).
What do they do?
<p>
Each has a CMake control file that 
builds a library from the source file
in that directory.  Each source file
defines a class that prints a message.
<p>
Now look at G.  There, you also see
a G class that's like the A-F ones,
but also a test executable (testG.cxx) 
that invokes the entire string of classes.
There's also a CMakeLists.txt file 
that controls both building the G library, and
also building the G executable.

<p>
Now build it and see if that executable runs:

 <CODE><PRE>
   cmake .
   make
   ./G/testG
 </PRE></code> 

All that should go well.
<p>
Note that there's a bug in D!  It's not printing
cleanly.  Usually, something like this gets fixed in source control, 
e.g. Git, and then checked out. CMake and make then
do their job to build a executable with the fix.

<p>

The structure is not so good, though.  What does testG
depend on?  If any of the A-G packages change, 
testG is going to have to change too.  That's a lot of 
coupling, and will make G a pain to maintain.
<p>
In larger systems, tools to compute and display the coupling
can be very helpful.  The image to the right 
was made automatically by CMake, using

 <CODE><PRE>
    cmake --graphviz=foo.dot
    dot -o foo.png -Tpng foo.dot
 </PRE></code> 
Run those, and take a look at the foo.png file.

<h3>Episode IV: A New Structure</h3>

A better way to structure this code might be to have
each class forward the work of it's predecessor.
For example, B could invoke A and then print its own report; 
C could invoke B and then print its own report; etc.
<p>
<img src="exM2fig2.png" ALIGN="RIGHT" HEIGHT="485" WIDTH="64"/>
This is not just a change to CMake files or even to source files.
It's a change to the system which reduces the complexity 
& coupling by changing each from "Just tell me about yourself" 
to "Tell me about yourself and the ones that follow you". 
The first, "about yourself"
seems simple, until you realize that everybody using the code needs
to know much more about everything.  The second, "yourself and followers",
moves that responsibility from being spread across all the using classes
to being localized in each specific package.
<p>
To see this in practice:

 <CODE><PRE>
   cd
   ./csc_get exerciseM2A.tar
   tar xf exerciseM2A.tar
   cd exerciseM2A
   source setup.sh
 </PRE></code> 

Now look at a couple classes, say starting with
<code>C/C.h</code> and <code>C/C.cxx</code>.  They 
include and reference their successor.  
The CMakeLists.txt
file had to make sure that C could
properly reference B, both at include-time and 
link-time. Compare this C/CMakeLists.txt
with the one in the C package in your ~/exerciseM2
directory to see that.
The include-time statements we'd 
see before.  To handle linking, we added a 
<code>target_link_libraries(C B)</code> line
to tell it which libraries link together.
<p>
The G package is simpler, though. It had been necessary to name
everything at link time before:
 <CODE><PRE>
    target_link_libraries (testG A B C D E F G) 
 </PRE></code> 
but now you just have to link against the 
G libraries:
 <CODE><PRE>
    target_link_libraries (testG G) 
 </PRE></code> 
Take a look at G.h, G.cxx and testG.cxx and make sure you understand this.

<p>
Still, it works fine:
 <CODE><PRE>
   cmake .
   make
   ./G/testG
 </PRE></code> 
produces the same output.

<h3>Handling Change</h3>

To see how structure impacts change, and to 
get a little more experience, 
we want you to create a new sub-system:
<ul>
<li>Subsystem D2 will help D do it's job.
<li>It should live in a new D2 directory and create it's own library.
<li>It should contain a D2 class that is invoked
    by the D class to do the actual printing.
</ul>
<img src="exM2fig3.png" ALIGN="RIGHT" HEIGHT="485" WIDTH="120"/>
The intended structure is shown on the right.
<p>
<blockquote><div style="background-color:#ECECEC; color:#000000">
(Hint for new C++ programmers:  You can create a new directory D2,
copy the D files to it, change the references to D to D2 throughout,
and then change D.cxx to D2.cxx containing
 <CODE><PRE>
#include "D2.h"

void D::print ()
{
        cout&lt;&lt;"Hello from D via D2"&lt;&lt;endl;
}
 </PRE></CODE> 
plus appropriate changes in D's CMakeLists.txt file.
You also have to declare a new subdirectory in the top-level
CMakeLists.txt file)
</div></blockquote>
<p>
In a perfect world, you could create this with only changes to
D and D2, not anything else.
See if that works in this structure.  Are there any problems?
Do you need to change anything else?
If you're the D programmer, do you need to coordinate with people?
<p>
<blockquote><div style="background-color:#ECECEC; color:#000000">
(Hint: If you're not able to get this after a little bit of work, there's
a working version you can get with 
    <CODE><PRE>
    cd
    csc_get exerciseM2B.tar
    tar xf exerciseM2B.tar
    </pre></code>
and then look at)
</div></blockquote>
<p>
Then try the same thing in the previous exerciseM2 structure.
 <CODE><PRE>
   cd ~/exerciseM2
   (copy your changes over & edit as needed)
 </PRE></code> 

Is that structure as independent?  If D had dozens of users, not just E and G,
which structure is easier to roll out?
