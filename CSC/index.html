</head>
<body>
<h1>Tools exercises:</h1>

Please see the 
<a href="#general">general notes</a> at the bottom of this page.
<p>
There is no particular time expected for these. You should
do them in order, but it's OK to spend more time on the ones that
interest you and go quickly through others.  Generally,
students get through the Test and Performance Issues groups in Monday's exercise period, 
and may start the Memory Issues exercise. 
They then start Tuesday's exercise period with finishing up 
anything they want to from Monday, complete Memory Issues and  
Code Management and do as much of Build and Release
Management as they find useful. 
<p>
Nobody does every bit of
every exercise, and that's OK. Quite a few groups will
probably stop around the end of the CMake exercises.
<p>
If you run out of time and want to 
do more on particular topics, you can come back to these topics later
in the week or load a copy onto your own machine.

<p>
The very first step is get the School's virtual machine installed and running on your laptop, and then to log in.
For more information on how to do that, see the School's
<a href="http://csc.web.cern.ch/Laptop-Exercises-Requirements">Laptop configuration page</a>.

<p>
If you haven't done this yet, open a Terminal window and get
a copy of the exercise files:
<code><pre>
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/bobjacobsen/csc-exercises.git
</pre></code>
Finally, so a bit of setup:
<code><pre>
source csc-exercises/CSC/setup
</pre></code>
<p>
Now move on the the instructions for each exercise.

<h3>Test Frameworks</h3>
1) 
<A HREF="ex1.html">ex1.html</a>
Demonstration of a test framework
<P>
2) 
<A HREF="ex2.html">ex2.html</a>
Practice debugging using a test framework (Java)
<P>

D)
<A HREF="exD.html">exD.html</a>
Simple use of CppUnit (Requires some C++ experience)
<P>


<h3>Performance Profiling</h3>

3) 
<A HREF="ex3.html">ex3.html</a>
Demonstration of profiling tool
<P>

4) 
<A HREF="ex4.html">ex4.html</a>
Practice tuning a small application
<P>

<h3>Memory Issues</h3>
Experienced C and C++ programmers might find this interesting, but 
perhaps a little basic (though the valgrind tool can be 
useful even for experts).  Everybody else should definitely
do this one to learn more about how memory really works.
<p>
5) 
<A HREF="ex5.html">ex5.html</a>
Testing for C++ memory faults
<P>

<h3>Code Management</h3>
If you don't use SVN and want an introduction, or 
if you're a SVN user who wants to mess around with 
no risk to your code, do exercise C.  Otherwise,
jump to the Git exercises G1 through G3. They're
more in line with the future.
<p>
C)
<A HREF="exC.html">exC.html</a>
Simple use of SVN

<h2 id="corrections" name="corrections">Corrections</h2>
 
If there are any last-minute corrections to the instructions, 
we will post them in the exercise room. To update your local copy, do
<code><pre>
    cd ~/csc-exercises
    git pull
</pre></code>
and then refresh your web browser windows to pick up the new instructions.

<h2>Files</h2>

Updated PDF files are available for 
<a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/581756/contributions/2359694/">lecture 1</a> and
<a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/581756/contributions/2359696/">lecture 2</a> in Indico.
<p>
We continually update the exercises in GitHub.  
After the School is complete, you can get the specific version we used 
by looking for the 
<a href="https://github.com/bobjacobsen/csc-exercises/releases">CSC-2017</a> release tag.

<h2 id="general">General notes:</h2>

These exercises involve some minimal Java and/or C++ programming.  
We recommend that you arrange yourself in groups so that somebody in 
each group has at least a little experience with Java and/or C++.
<P> 
Note that the instructions for these exercises are written for a Bash-type shell.  If you use a C-type shell:
<OL>
<LI>Replace "export SOMETHING=..." with "setenv SOMETHING ..."
<LI>Replace "source setup.sh" with "source setup.csh"
</OL>

<p>
Style convention:  Indented commands in <code>code font</code> are meant to 
be cut and pasted into a command line:
<code><pre>
    cd
    echo "Done!"
</pre></code>
When we want to show the output from a command, we'll include the command prompt:
<code><pre>
$date
Thu June 15 10:37:13 PDT 2015
</pre></code>
That's not meant to be cut-and-pasted in its entirety, just the parts 
after the $ or % command prompt.

<h2 id="biblio">Bibliography</h2>

The bibliography is kept in a 
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jvb1zYRibzOw74VKnGsmTVfWkQcOxb_yc8JboebFDpA/edit#">Google Doc</a>.
It is periodically updated as cool new things are found.
