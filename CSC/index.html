<body>
<h1>Tools exercises:</h1>

Please see the notes at the bottom of this page.
<p>
There is no particular time expected for these. You should
do them in order, but it's OK to spend more time on the ones that
interest you and go quickly through others.  Generally,
students get through the Test and Performance Issues groups in Monday's exercise period, 
and may start the Memory Issues exercise. 
They then start Tuesday's exercise period with finishing up 
anything they want to from Monday, complete Memory Issues and  
Code Management and do as much of Build and Release
Management as they find useful. 
<p>
Nobody does every bit of
every exercise, and that's OK. Quite a few groups will
probably stop around the end CMake exercises.
<p>
If you run out of time and want to 
do more on particular topics, you can come back to these topics later
in the week or load a copy onto your own machine.

<p>
The very first step is to bring over a script we'll use to 
transfer the exercise files:
<code><pre>
wget http://server/jake/CSC/csc_get
chmod 755 csc_get
</pre></code>
<p>
Now move on the the instructions for each exercise.

<h2>Corrections</h2>
 
If there are any last-minute corrections to the instructions, 
we will post them in the exercise room. 
Electronic copies of these instructions and additional documentation can be found at URL:

<P> 
<A HREF="http:/server/jake/CSC/index.html">http:/server/jake/CSC/index.html</a>

<h2>Files</h2>

Updated PDF files are available for 
<a href="Lecture1.pdf">lecture 1</a> and
<a href="Lecture2.pdf">lecture 2</a>.
<p>
If you want to take the exercises with you, please download the
<a href="../CSC.tar">exercise tar file<a> and the
<a href="../cmt-dev-all.tgz">CMT install file<a>
<u>after</u> Wednesday, which will allow us to update those tar files
with any changes from this year.
If you need to rebuild CMT for your local machine (which is easy!), 
see the <a href="install_cmt.html">instructions</a>.

<h2 id="biblio">Bibliography</h2>

The bibliography is kept in a 
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jvb1zYRibzOw74VKnGsmTVfWkQcOxb_yc8JboebFDpA/edit#">Google Doc</a>.
It is periodically updated as cool new things are found.

<h2>General notes:</h2>

These exercises involve some minimal Java and/or C++ programming.  
We recommend that you arrange yourself in groups so that somebody in 
each group has at least a little experience with Java and/or C++.
<P> 
Note that the instructions for these exercises are written for a Bash-type shell.  If you use a C-type shell:
<OL>
<LI>Replace "export SOMETHING=..." with "setenv SOMETHING ..."
<LI>Replace "source setup.sh" with "source setup.csh"
</OL>

<p>
Style convention:  Indented commands in <code>code font</code> are meant to 
be cut and pasted into a command line:
<code><pre>
    cd
    echo "Done!"
</pre></code>
When we want to show the output from a command, we'll include the command prompt:
<code><pre>
$date
Thu June 15 10:37:13 PDT 2015
</pre></code>
That's not meant to be cut-and-pasted in its entirety, just the parts 
after the $ or % command prompt.
