	<title>Index of Tools Exercises</title>

<body>
<h1>Tools exercises:</h1>

Please read this all the way through first, to get an idea 
of the overall plan of the exercises. Note that there are some  
<a href="#general">general notes</a> at the bottom of this page.
<p>
There is no particular time expected for these. You should
do them in order, but it's OK to spend more time on the ones that
interest you and go quickly through others.  It's completely
fine to skip the ones marked "optional".

Generally, some students will just complete the Memory Issues 
exercise on Monday, while others will be well into the Code Management exercises.
It depends on what's most interesting to them.  
They then start Tuesday's exercise period with finishing up 
anything they want to from Monday, complete Memory Issues and  
Code Management and do as much of Build and Release
Management as they find useful. 
<p>
Nobody does every bit of
every exercise, and that's OK. Quite a few groups will
probably stop around the end of the Code Management exercises, or 
having just started the Release Management ones.
<p>
If you run out of time and want to 
do more on particular topics, you can come back to these topics later
in the week. They can be run anywhere.  But please don't feel compelled to
work on these after Tuesday; there is a lot more to the School!

<p>
The very first step is get a partner to work with.  You can change, and
teams often do, but it's much better to work with somebody that to try to learn alone.

<p>
Next, get the School's virtual machine installed and running on your laptop, and then log in.
For more information on how to do that, see the School's
<a href="http://csc.web.cern.ch/Laptop-Exercises-Requirements">Laptop configuration page</a>.

<p>
Then open a Terminal window and get
a copy of the exercise files:
<code><pre>
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/bobjacobsen/csc-exercises.git
</pre></code>
Finally, so a bit of setup:
<code><pre>
source csc-exercises/CSC/setup
</pre></code>

<p>
Tell use who makes up your team, so we can find you later with updates:
<code><pre>
./csc_log team oneName otherName
</pre></code>

<p>
Now move on to the instructions for each exercise.

<h3>Test Frameworks</h3>
1) 
<A HREF="ex1.html">ex1.html</a>
Demonstration of a test framework - basic - this is a simple exercise to make sure
that your laptop VM is working, you and your teammate can settle in, etc.
<P>
You should do at least one of the next two exercises to work with test frameworks in 
a little more depth.  Exercise D on CppUnit (testing C++) requires a bit of experience with C++, 
while Exercise 2 is more accessible to people without C++ experience.

<p>
2) 
<A HREF="ex2.html">ex2.html</a>
Practice debugging using a test framework (Java) - basic
<P>

D)
<A HREF="exD.html">exD.html</a>
Simple use of CppUnit - intermediate (Requires some C++ experience)
<P>


<h3>Performance Profiling</h3>

Both of these exercises are optional.   They demonstrate how tools, even simple ones
can help you focus on in where time is really being spent.  Later lectures and exercises
will cover this in much more detail. If you've already worked with performance tools,
you can certainly skip these; if not, they might get you thinking a bit.
<P>

3) 
<A HREF="ex3.html">ex3.html</a>
Demonstration of profiling tool
<P>

4) 
<A HREF="ex4.html">ex4.html</a>
Practice tuning a small application
<P>

<h3>Memory Issues</h3>
Experienced C and C++ programmers might find this  
perhaps a little basic (though the valgrind tool can be 
useful even for experts).  Everybody else should definitely
do this one to learn more about how memory really works.
<p>
5) 
<A HREF="ex5.html">ex5.html</a>
Testing for C++ memory faults
<P>

<h3>Code Management</h3>
If you don't use SVN and want an introduction, or 
if you're a SVN user who wants to mess around with 
no risk to your code, do optional exercise C.  Otherwise,
jump to the Git exercises G1 through G3. They're
more in line with the future.
<p>
C)
<A HREF="exC.html">exC.html</a>
Simple use of SVN - optional, intended for people who are using SVN and want to know more, 
or who expect to be using it sometime soon.
<P>

G1)
<A HREF="exG1.html">exG1.html</a>
Simple use of git - basic
<P>

G2)
<A HREF="exG2.html">exG2.html</a>
Experience with Git branching - intermediate
<P>

G3)
<A HREF="exG3.html">exG3.html</a>
Distributed development with Git - advanced
<P>


 
<h3>Build and Release Management</h3>



M1)
<A HREF="exM1.html">exM1.html</a>
Introduction to CMake - basic
<P>

M2)
<A HREF="exM2.html">exM2.html</a>
CMake as a release tool - intermediate 
<P>

The next three are very optional.  They provide experience
with release-specification tools using CMT as an example.
Of interest historically, these tools are also in use today.
So if you're in a collaboration that uses this type of
tool, you might enjoy learning about them.
<P>
7)
<A HREF="ex7.html">ex7.html</a>
Simple release build activities with CMT - optional, basic 
<P>

8) 
<A HREF="ex8.html">ex8.html</a>
Releasing code changes with CMT - optional, intermediate
<P>

9)
<A HREF="ex9.html">ex9.html</a>
Managing configuration conflicts in CMT - optional, advanced
<P>

The last exercise is recommended, but somewhat advanced and open-ended. It's OK
for student to run out of time in the middle somewhere.  But it's a useful experience to 
attempt it.
<P>
F) 
<a href="exF.html">exF.html</a>
Distributed Development with Git and CMake - advanced


<!-- 
    <h3>Optional, for people who want to know CVS</h3>
    Only do these if you want to know about CVS or its internals
    <p>A) <A HREF="exA.html">exA.html</a> Simple use of CVS
    <p>B) <A HREF="exB.html">exB.html</a> More advanced CVS, showing how conflicts are handled
    <p>

<h2 id="corrections" name="corrections">Corrections</h2>
 
If there are any last-minute corrections to the instructions, 
we will post them in the exercise room. To update your local copy, do
<code><pre>
    cd ~/csc-exercises
    git pull
</pre></code>
and then refresh your web browser windows to pick up the new instructions.

<h2>Files</h2>

Updated PDF files are available for 
<a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/581756/contributions/2359694/">lecture 1</a> and
<a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/581756/contributions/2359696/">lecture 2</a> in Indico.
<p>
We continually update the exercises in GitHub.  
After the School is complete, you can get the specific version we used 
by looking for the 
<a href="https://github.com/bobjacobsen/csc-exercises/releases">CSC-2017</a> release tag.

<h2 id="general">General notes:</h2>

These exercises involve some minimal Java and/or C++ programming.  
We recommend that you arrange yourself in groups so that somebody in 
each group has at least a little experience with Java and/or C++.
<P> 
Note that the instructions for these exercises are written for a Bash-type shell.  If you use a C-type shell:
<OL>
<LI>Replace "export SOMETHING=..." with "setenv SOMETHING ..."
<LI>Replace "source setup.sh" with "source setup.csh"
</OL>

<p>
Style convention:  Indented commands in <code>code font</code> are meant to 
be cut and pasted into a command line:
<code><pre>
    cd
    echo "Done!"
</pre></code>
When we want to show the output from a command, we'll include the command prompt:
<code><pre>
$date
Thu June 15 10:37:13 PDT 2017
</pre></code>
That's not meant to be cut-and-pasted in its entirety, just the parts 
after the $ or % command prompt.

<h2 id="biblio">Bibliography</h2>

The bibliography is kept in a 
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jvb1zYRibzOw74VKnGsmTVfWkQcOxb_yc8JboebFDpA/edit#">Google Doc</a>.
It is periodically updated as cool new things are found.
