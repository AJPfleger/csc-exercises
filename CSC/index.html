<h1>Index of Tools Exercises</h1>

Please read this all the way through first, to get an idea 
of the overall plan of the exercises. Note that there are some  
<a href="#general">general notes</a> at the bottom of this page.

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
The very first step is get a partner to work with.  You can change, and
teams often do, but it's much better to work with somebody than to try to learn alone.

<p>
Next, get the School's virtual machine installed and running on your laptop, and then log in.
For more information on how to do that, see the School's
<a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/769356/page/15184-laptop-configuration">Laptop configuration page</a>.

<p>
Then open a Terminal window and get
a copy of the exercise files:
<code><pre>
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/bobjacobsen/csc-exercises.git
</pre></code>
Do a bit of setup (this only has to be done once):
<code><pre>
source csc-exercises/CSC/setup
</pre></code>

<p>
Finally, tell us who makes up your team, so we can find you later with updates:
<code><pre>
./csc_log team "One Student Name" "Other Student Name"
</pre></code>

<h3>About the Exercises</h3>

There is no particular time expected for these exercises. 
You should
do them in order, but it's OK to spend more time on the ones that
interest you and go quickly through others.  It's completely
fine to skip the ones marked "optional".
<p>
Generally, in the Tuesday morning exercise period
most students will complete the Test Framework and Performance sections
and get part way through the Memory exercise or even finish it.
Although some exercises are optional, it's best to use that entire time
on these three parts.
<p>
People will then use the Wednesday afternoon exercise period to complete 
the Code Management topic and do as much of Build and Release
Management as they find useful. 
<p>
Nobody does every bit of every exercise, and that's OK.
<p>
If you run out of time and want to 
do more on particular topics, you can come back to these topics later
in the week. They can be run anywhere.  But please don't feel compelled to
work on these after the scheduled sessions; there is a lot more to the School!

<p>
Now move on to the instructions for each exercise.
<p>
A short comment on structure: Many of these exercises start by asking you
to create a directory by unpacking a .tar file.  We do this so that, if you 
get too confused about the contents of things, you can just delete the directory
and create a new one.  You can't break anything, so please feel free to experiment!

<h3>Test Frameworks</h3>
1) 
<A HREF="ex1.html">ex1.html</a>
Demonstration of a test framework - basic - this is a simple exercise to make sure
that your laptop VM is working, you and your teammate can settle in, etc.
<P>
You should do at least one of the next three exercises to work with test frameworks in 
a little more depth. It's also OK to do all three; the later ones will be fast.
Exercise D on CppUnit (testing C++) requires a bit of experience with C++, 
and exercise P requires a bit of Python experience.

<p>
2) 
<A HREF="ex2.html">ex2.html</a>
Practice debugging using a test framework (Java) - basic
<P>

D)
<A HREF="exD.html">exD.html</a>
Simple use of CppUnit - intermediate (Requires some C++ experience)
<P>

P)
<A HREF="exP.html">exP.html</a>
Simple use of PyUnit - intermediate (Requires some Python experience)
<P>


<h3>Performance Profiling</h3>

Both of these exercises are optional.   They demonstrate how tools, even simple ones
can help you focus on in where time is really being spent.  Later lectures and exercises
will cover this in much more detail. If you've already worked with performance tools,
you can certainly skip these; if not, they might get you thinking a bit.
<P>

3) 
<A HREF="ex3.html">ex3.html</a>
Demonstration of profiling tool - optional
<P>

4) 
<A HREF="ex4.html">ex4.html</a>
Practice tuning a small application - optional
<P>

<h3>Memory Issues</h3>
People with experience programming C and C++ close to the hardware might find this  
a little basic (though the valgrind tool can be  useful even for experts).  
Everybody else should definitely
do this one to learn more about how memory really works.
<p>
5) 
<A HREF="ex5.html">ex5.html</a>
Testing for C++ memory faults
<P>

<h3>Code Management</h3>
If you don't use SVN and want an introduction, or 
if you're a SVN user who wants to mess around with 
no risk to your code, do optional exercise C.  Otherwise,
jump to the Git exercises G1 through G3. They're
more in line with the future.
<p>

C)
<A HREF="exC.html">exC.html</a>
Simple use of SVN - optional, intended for people who are using SVN and want to know more, 
or who expect to be using it sometime soon.
<P>

G1)
<A HREF="exG1.html">exG1.html</a>
Simple use of git - basic
<P>

G2)
<A HREF="exG2.html">exG2.html</a>
Experience with Git branching - intermediate
<P>

G3)
<A HREF="exG3.html">exG3.html</a>
Distributed development with Git - advanced
<P>


<h3>Build and Release Management</h3>

There are three <u>very optional</u> exercises that probide experience
with release-specification tools using CMT as an example.
If you're in a collaboration that uses this type of
tool, you might enjoy learning about them; 
otherwise we recommend you skip them. 
(7) <A HREF="ex7.html">ex7.html</a>
Simple release build activities with CMT - optional, basic;
(8) <A HREF="ex8.html">ex8.html</a>
Releasing code changes with CMT - optional, intermediate;
(9) <A HREF="ex9.html">ex9.html</a>
Managing configuration conflicts in CMT - optional, advanced.
<P>


M1)
<A HREF="exM1.html">exM1.html</a>
Introduction to CMake - basic
<P>

M2)
<A HREF="exM2.html">exM2.html</a>
CMake as a release tool - intermediate 
<P>

The last exercise is recommended, but somewhat open-ended. It's OK
for student to run out of time in the middle somewhere.  But it's a useful experience to 
attempt it.
<P>
F) 
<a href="exF.html">exF.html</a>
Distributed Development with Git and CMake - advanced


<!-- 
    <h3>Optional, for people who want to know CVS</h3>
    Only do these if you want to know about CVS or its internals
    <p>A) <A HREF="exA.html">exA.html</a> Simple use of CVS
    <p>B) <A HREF="exB.html">exB.html</a> More advanced CVS, showing how conflicts are handled
    <p>
 -->

<h2 id="corrections" name="corrections">Corrections</h2>
 
If there are any last-minute corrections to the instructions, 
we will post them in the exercise room. To update your local copy, do
<code><pre>
    cd ~/csc-exercises
    git pull
    cd
</pre></code>
and then refresh your web browser windows to pick up the new instructions.

<h2>Files</h2>

Updated PDF files are available for 
<a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/769356/contributions/3197066/">lecture 1</a> and
<a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/769356/contributions/3197063/">lecture 2</a> in Indico.

<p>
We continually update the exercises in GitHub.  
After the School is complete, you can get the specific version we used 
by looking for the 
<a href="https://github.com/bobjacobsen/csc-exercises/releases">CSC-2019</a> release tag.

<h2 id="general">General notes:</h2>

These exercises involve some minimal Java and/or C++ programming.  
We recommend that you arrange yourself in groups so that somebody in 
each group has at least a little experience with Java and/or C++.
<P> 
Note that the instructions for these exercises are written for a Bash-type shell.  If you use a C-type shell:
<OL>
<LI>Replace "export SOMETHING=..." with "setenv SOMETHING ..."
<LI>Replace "source setup.sh" with "source setup.csh"
</OL>

<p>
Style convention:  Indented commands in <code>code font</code> are meant to 
be cut and pasted into a command line:
<code><pre>
    cd
    echo "Done!"
</pre></code>
When we want to show the output from a command, we'll include the command prompt:
<code><pre>
$date
Thu June 15 10:37:13 PDT 2018
</pre></code>
That's not meant to be cut-and-pasted in its entirety, just the parts 
after the $ or % command prompt.

<h2 id="biblio">Bibliography</h2>

The bibliography is kept in a 
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jvb1zYRibzOw74VKnGsmTVfWkQcOxb_yc8JboebFDpA/edit#">Google Doc</a>.
It is periodically updated as cool new things are found.
