<h1>Exercise D: Experiment with CppUnit</h1>
 
Reminder: If there's been a correction to this exercise posted, 
update your local copy via
<A HREF="index.html#corrections">these instructions</a>
before proceeding.
 
<P>
Goal: Gain familiarity with CppUnit

<p>
CppUnit is a unit test framework for C++ code.  As such, it's typically
integrated into the usual C++ build systems using "make" or similar.
In this exercise, we're going to focus on writing and running simple CppUnit
tests within an existing make structure.

<p>
Start by expanding a pre-built copy of CppUnit that we've created for use
with the CSC machines:  (If you want to build a copy for your own machine,
see the last section of these instructions)

<CODE><PRE>
    cd
    ./csc_get exerciseD.tar
    tar xf exerciseD.tar
    cd exerciseD
</PRE></CODE>

<p>
We'll be working with the "simple" example that's provided with CppUnit (though
we've made some small changes in it for the purposes of this exercise):
<CODE><PRE>
   cd examples/simple
</PRE></CODE>

The sample tests are in the ExampleTestCase.cpp file.  They look like this:

<CODE><PRE>
    void ExampleTestCase::example()
    {
      CPPUNIT_ASSERT_DOUBLES_EQUAL( 1.0, 1.1, 0.05 );
      CPPUNIT_ASSERT( 1 == 0 );
      CPPUNIT_ASSERT( 1 == 1 );
    }
</PRE></CODE>

That's a single test method, which asserts three separate things:
<ul>
<li>1.0 and 1.1 are equal, where the comparison has a range specification that
    says "has to be within 0.05 of each other"
    so that floating-point numbers can be meaningfully compared.
<li> 1 is equal to 0
<li> 1 is equal to 1
</ul>

These aren't real tests, of course, but rather demonstrations of what can easily be tested 
and what happens when they pass or fail. In this case, the first test will fail.
To see that, make and run the tests (see below about failures; you'll probably have to rebuild 
CppUnit the first time through):

<CODE><PRE>
    make
    ./simple
</PRE></CODE>

The "make" might say it has nothing to do this first time through. That's OK, proceed.
Sometimes, i.e. when running on your own machines, you'll get a link error in the "make" command, 
which means our pre-built
version of CppUnit is out-of-sync with the local compiler or libraries.
If that happens, you can fix it by rebuilding CppUnit with:
<CODE><PRE>
    cd ~/exerciseD
    ./configure
    make
    cd examples/simple
</PRE></CODE>

When you do "./simple", the program runs all the tests, 
giving a brief summary of whether they failed ("assertion")
or passed ("OK").  Then it prints a report on each failure it encountered, for example:


<CODE><PRE>
    ExampleTestCase.cpp:8: Assertion
    Test name: ExampleTestCase::example
    double equality assertion failed
    - Expected: 1
    - Actual  : 1.1
    - Delta   : 0.05
</PRE></CODE>

That's enough to let you track down the problem.
Edit line 8 of the ExampleTestCase.cpp file so that this tests passes, and then
rebuild the program and try again:

<CODE><PRE>
    make
    ./simple
</PRE></CODE>

Now it fails in the next assertion in that test method.
That assertion apparently wasn't run before, back when the method was asserting at the first statement.
This is characteristic of unit testing:
once a problem has been found in a test method, that method stops and the program proceeds to the
next one.  The idea here is that the test has worked, a problem has been found, and it's too tricky to 
work out whether the objects involved are still in a good state to continue testing.  Better to 
report this result and move to the next test.

<p>
Play with these test methods until you get comfortable with how the assertions work, what they test, etc.
Note how the setUp() routine can provide common initialization used by multiple tests.

<p>
Now we want to add another test case, called "newExample".  That's involves adding a new
method in the ExampleTestCase.cpp file:

<CODE><PRE>
void ExampleTestCase::newExample()
{
  // some assertions of your choice
}
</PRE></CODE>

Add that, and run "make".

<p>
The "make" failed because in C++ you have to declare new methods, which is (generally)
done in header files. Open the ExampleTestCase.h file and take a look at it.

<p>
The bottom half contains the method declarations that you're used to from C++ programming.
The top part contains the statements that tell CppUnit which methods are tests
and how they're grouped into a test suite:

<CODE><PRE>
  CPPUNIT_TEST_SUITE( ExampleTestCase );
  CPPUNIT_TEST( example );
  CPPUNIT_TEST( anotherExample );
  CPPUNIT_TEST( testAdd );
  CPPUNIT_TEST( testSucceeds );
  CPPUNIT_TEST( testEquals );
  CPPUNIT_TEST_SUITE_END();
</PRE></CODE>

You'll need to add a declaration for your new method in the bottom part, and also a new
CPPUNIT_TEST statement in this part for it.

<p>
Do that, "make", run the tests and make sure that your new code is being executed.

<p>
Finally, lets look at how the overall test system is organized. CppUnit is a very flexible
system, which can be customized in lots of ways.  The executable that invokes the tests
can be found in Main.cpp.  Open that and look at the comments on each step:
<dl>
<dt>"Create the event manager and test controller" <dd>This creates the basic infrastructure
that's always needed.
<dt>"Add a listener that collects test result" <dd>CppUnit is organized around listeners
that get told when things happen.  In this case, we're installing a listener that will
make a record of the results of each test for use later on in the program (see last point below).
<dt>"Add a listener that prints tests names as test runs." <dd>The beauty of the listener pattern
is that you can have lots of them, and then include just the ones you want.  Here, we're 
also including a listener that gives us a quick summary of each test as it executes.
<dt>"Add the top suite to the test runner" <dd>This is how CppUnit knows what tests to
run.  Individual tests are organized into suites, which in turn can be grouped into 
further suites, etc. Note that this doesn't explicitly refer to ExampleTestCase. 
This line invokes a routine that scans for test suites that have been identified
at compile-time.  This means that you don't have to change Main.cpp if you 
add a new test class, so long as you make sure it's getting linked in.
<dt>"Run tests" <dd>Really, this is the simplest part.  Now that it's set up, CppUnit
can run through the tests accumulating results
<dt>"Print test in a compiler compatible format." <dd>After the tests are done, the accumulated
results are formatted up as desired and printed.  Doing it this way makes it easy to 
report problems in different ways:  To the screen for interactive builds, or by email for
nightly builds, etc.
</dl>

Try commenting out various parts, "make" and run the tests to see what happens.
There are a number of more advanced tools that can be added to the test setup,
see the "More Information" section for pointers.

<h2>Installing CppUnit</h2>

(This section is not part of the formal CERN School exercise. 
Usually, CppUnit will be installed by central support services.
But if you have your own computer, and want to know more about CppUnit
here's some help.)
<p>
If you want to see what it takes to build your own copy of CppUnit,
get your own copy of the installation tar file:

<CODE><PRE>
    cd
    ./csc_get cppunit.tar
    tar xf cppunit.tar
</PRE></CODE>

CppUnit works very closely with the compiler and libraries on the computer, 
and has to be configured to match them.  This is done automatically using the
"autoconf" program:

<CODE><PRE>
   cd cppunit
   ./configure
</PRE></CODE>

This will run for a little while, maybe 30 seconds or so, first telling you about 
all the things it checked, and then listing the files it configured.
(Sometimes there are warnings from rm after that as it cleans up, but
you can ignore those)

<p>
Finally, you can build your copy:

<CODE><PRE>
   make
</PRE></CODE>

Once that's done, you can drop down to the examples/simple directory and see 
where we started with the prebuilt version at that start of the exercise.
